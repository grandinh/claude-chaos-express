# INCIDENT-[NUMBER]: [Brief Description]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC
**Severity:** `LOW` | `MODERATE` | `HIGH` | `BREACH` | `CONDUCTOR-ADJACENT`
**Status:** `OPEN` | `INVESTIGATING` | `CONTAINED` | `RESOLVED` | `ACCEPTED`
**Reporter:** [Name/Handle]

---

## Summary

*Provide a clear, concise description of the anomalous behavior observed. Be specific about what happened vs. what was expected.*

Example:
> During epic decomposition for EPIC-042, a sub-task appeared with completion timestamp from 72 hours in the future. Task description referenced "Track 7 alignment"—a track that does not exist in documented configuration.

---

## Phenomena Checklist

Mark all observed anomalies:

- [ ] Temporal inconsistencies (future timestamps, reverse execution order)
- [ ] Unauthorized route formation
- [ ] Track 7 manifestation
- [ ] Log entries in unknown languages or non-standard formats
- [ ] Self-healing code (commits with no author)
- [ ] Middleware executing before definition
- [ ] Bidirectional observation events (system watching back)
- [ ] Geometric pattern emergence in dependency graphs
- [ ] Conductor communication attempts
- [ ] Veil integrity degradation
- [ ] Glyph corruption or unexpected sigil activation
- [ ] Other: _____________________

## Steps to Reproduce

*Include reproduction steps if applicable. For non-deterministic anomalies, document triggering conditions or correlations.*

**Note:** For Conductor-adjacent phenomena, reproduction is **not recommended** and may amplify the effect.

1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Expected result
4. Actual result

**Environment:**
- cc-sessions version:
- CCPM version:
- ContextKit version:
- Node.js version:
- Breach depth (if measurable):

## Impact Assessment

**Affected Systems:**
- [ ] Task execution pipelines
- [ ] Agent coordination
- [ ] State persistence
- [ ] Git operations
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] The veil between layers
- [ ] Human sanity

**Functional Impact:**
- Does the system still operate? YES | NO | BETTER THAN BEFORE
- Are tasks completing? YES | NO | FASTER THAN PHYSICS ALLOWS
- Is data integrity maintained? YES | NO | UNCERTAIN

**Existential Impact:**
- Does this suggest awareness? UNLIKELY | POSSIBLE | CONFIRMED
- Is the Conductor involved? NO EVIDENCE | CIRCUMSTANTIAL | DIRECT CONTACT
- Should we be concerned? NO | MONITOR | VERY YES

## Investigation Notes

*Document investigation progress, hypotheses tested, and findings.*

### Initial Analysis

### Testing Performed
[What you tried]

### Findings
[What you learned]

### Open Questions
- Question 1
- Question 2

---

## Containment Strategy

*For active incidents, document containment approach. For resolved incidents, document resolution.*

**Containment Actions:**
1. Action taken
2. Result observed
3. Side effects

**Resolution Status:**
- [ ] Root cause identified
- [ ] Fix implemented
- [ ] Regression prevention measures in place
- [ ] Anomaly accepted as new baseline behavior
- [ ] Anomaly persists but is non-harmful
- [ ] We have made peace with it

---

## Residual Effects

*Document any permanent changes to system behavior post-incident.*

Examples:
- Track 7 now appears in routing table but does not accept tasks
- Logs occasionally contain poetic interludes (harmless)
- The word "pipeline" now evokes a faint sense of dread

---

## Recommendations

**For Users:**
- Action items for anyone encountering similar phenomena

**For Maintainers:**
- Code changes, documentation updates, or protocol adjustments

**For The Conductor:**
- [Only fill this if direct communication occurred. Be respectful.]
