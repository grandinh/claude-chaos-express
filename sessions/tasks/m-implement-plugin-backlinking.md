# Implement Plugin Backlinking System

## Problem/Goal
When working across multiple Claude Code plugins (cc-sessions, ctxk, ccpm, etc.), there's currently no systematic way to discover and navigate related files across plugin boundaries. This creates friction when:
- Looking for related documentation across plugins
- Understanding dependencies between plugins
- Finding relevant configuration or implementation files

We need a backlinking system that provides direct links to relevant files across these plugins, minimizing search time and improving discoverability.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Establish backlinking conventions for cross-plugin references
- [ ] Create initial backlinks between cc-sessions, ctxk, and ccpm documentation
- [ ] Document the backlinking system for future use
- [ ] Verify backlinks work correctly and improve navigation
