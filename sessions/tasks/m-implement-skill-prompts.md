# Create Skill Prompt Files

## Problem/Goal
Create skill prompt files (`.claude/skills/*.md`) for each of the 10 skills defined in skill-rules.json (v2.0.0). Currently, skill-rules.json contains the trigger configuration (keywords, file patterns, DAIC modes) but the actual skill behavior/instructions are missing. Each skill needs a corresponding .md file that contains the prompt/instructions for what that skill should do when activated.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Specific, measurable outcome
- [ ] Another concrete goal
