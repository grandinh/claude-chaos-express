# Manual Task Dependencies
#
# This file allows you to declare task dependencies that may not be
# explicitly stated in task frontmatter. This is useful for:
# - Implicit dependencies discovered during analysis
# - Cross-references between tasks
# - Legacy task relationships
#
# Format:
#   task-id:
#     - dependency-task-id-1
#     - dependency-task-id-2
#
# Task IDs should match the task filename without the .md extension.
# You can also use task names if they're unique.

# CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES (Discovered 2025-01-27)
# ============================================================================

# Skill System Chain
h-implement-skill-validation-script:
  - REPAIR-skill-invocation-mechanism

# Conflict Resolution Chain (must sequence to avoid file conflicts)
REPAIR-pause-detection-robustness:
  - REPAIR-code-review-findings-workflow

# Documentation Chain (must sequence to avoid conflicts)
h-quick-framework-fixes:
  - REPAIR-consolidate-tier-docs

# Release Blocker Chain (explicit requirement from PRD)
m-release-v0.1.0-installable-package:
  - h-create-health-check-script
  - m-create-integration-tests
  - h-create-quick-start-guide
  - h-create-troubleshooting-guide

# ============================================================================
# NOTES
# ============================================================================
# 
# CONSOLIDATION (2025-01-27):
# - h-implement-conflict-resolution is superseded by REPAIR-code-review-findings-workflow
#   (both modify same files, address same issue - agent instructions vs hooks)
#
# FILE CONFLICTS (must sequence, not parallelize):
# - REPAIR-code-review-findings-workflow and REPAIR-pause-detection-robustness
#   both modify: post_tool_use.js, user_messages.js, sessions_enforce.js, shared_state.js
#
# PARALLELIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:
# - REPAIR-agent-registry-sot + REPAIR-context-lcmp-path-sync (different files)
# - h-implement-code-search-parallelization + h-implement-parallel-agent-invocation (different files)
# - All Phase 4 release blockers (different files, can all run in parallel)
